  앤의 버킷리스트</h2>
Greetings, visitors.
My name is <u>Ann</u> and this is my website for the gap year bucketlist.
The website comprises of list of things such as <strong>producing fairy tales, learning how to code,
learning how to produce music, and many more.</strong>
Please feel free to look around and contact me with encouragements and questions.

<p>I would like to become a person of use. I have flaws, but they are to be fixed.
If I could be of help, I want to help animals to live a better life. For a long
time, I have always wanted to found a cosmetic company.</p><p>However, as I adopted my dog, Dokdo,
I fell in love with how animals behave and deeply empathized with animals who get maltreatments from humans.
Therefore, I long to help them but at the same time, do the thing that excites me.
As a result, I came up with vegan cosmetic company. I want to prove people that beauty can be made without
taking it away from animals.</p>
